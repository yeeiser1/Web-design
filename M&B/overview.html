            "Day 48 - We are running out of food, we are running out of arrows, we are running out of men. Hope?
            Haven't run out of that one just yet. Lord Benyard is on his way with a company 200 strong and filled
            with some of the most well-trained troops that his land can offer.

            That was what the letter said when I received it 20 days ago, he still isn't here. He may not even be alive.
            We have been holding the city of Dhirim against the Rhodok horde as they lay siege against the city walls.
            Every morning they come with their ladders and their siegeworks and every morning we rain arrows and burning
            tar on them. If there's a higher power, He can see that we have endured, but for how much longer can we
            endure against the barbarians?"

            Mount & Blade: Warband is a 2012 videogame that offers an experience that can hardly be found in other
            titles
            and has grown to have its own cult following that still keeps the game alive to this day, more than a decade
            after the game came out.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept is simple: it is the 13th Century and you are the leader of a band of soldiers, what you do or
            how you do it
            is entirely up to you. You can be a mercenary, lending your sword to whoever has the deepest pockets. You
            can choose to
            set up industries accross the land and become a mercantile force so strong that you get to decide the tides
            of war and politics
            through commerce. You can dethrone a head of state and embark on a campaign of domination against the other
            nations. Or you
            can roam the land as a bandit, stealing from peasants and pillaging towns.
