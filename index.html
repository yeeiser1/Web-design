            We have been holding the city of Dhirim against the Rhodok horde as they lay siege against the city walls.
            Every morning they come with their ladders and their siegeworks and every morning we rain arrows and burning
            tar on them. If there's a higher power, He can see that we have endured, but for how much longer can we
            endure against the barbarians?"

            Mount & Blade: Warband is a 2012 videogame that offers an experience that can hardly be found in other
            titles
            and has grown to have its own cult following that still keeps the game alive to this day, more than a decade
            after the game came out.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept is simple: it is the 13th Century and you are the leader of a band of soldiers, what you do or
            how you do it
            is entirely up to you. You can be a mercenary, lending your sword to whoever has the deepest pockets. You
            can choose to
            set up industries accross the land and become a mercantile force so strong that you get to decide the tides
            of war and politics
            through commerce. You can dethrone a head of state and embark on a campaign of domination against the other
            nations. Or you
            can roam the land as a bandit, stealing from peasants and pillaging towns.

            The series has had 4 entries since its inception back in 2008, with its latest addition being the War Sails
            expansion released in November 2025 for the latest entry in the series, Mount & Blade: Bannerlord. Initially,
            the series began in the garage of TaleWorld founder Armağan Yavuz who, with the help of his wife, began working
            on a yet untitled project that aimed to combine historical fiction with the depth of strategy games such Sid Meier's Pirates.
            The project grew to become a full production that despite its small team, it managed to shipped a full product.

            It tanked.

            Sales were low and critics gave it an average rating of 6/10, yet the players made a small but passionate community surrounding
            the game thanks to its easy moddability. A few years later Mount & Blade: Warband would release, it was a remake
            of the first game with many mechanics and systems reworked to add more depth and freedom, as well as a new Persian-themed 
            faction was added. The success of both critically and financially of this remake would grow to become one of Paradox's 
            biggest accomplishments of the 2010s.

            Now that players could influence economies and raise their own kingdoms, the developers had to come up with something new
            to push their brand to new horizons and that came in the shape of the Napoleonic Wars expansion which changed the setting to
            the 18th Century, and later came the Viking Conquest expansion which recreated the Danish occupation of the British Isles
            in the 9th Century.
