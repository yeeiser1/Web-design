        <p>
            Shortly after release, the developers set their sights on expanding the game to new horizons beyond just 
            the medieval Europe setting. The idea was to completely change the fundamentals of the game and move it away 
            from the sword and shield gameplay that they had worked on thus far, and so the <em>Napoleonic Wars</em> DLC was born.
        </p>

        <p>
            A multiplayer-only expansion that centered around 19th Century warfare and tactics. The addition of firearms
            and artillery coupled with the slow movement and reload time made the perfect combination of factors to force 
            the playerbase to adopt some of the real life strategies of the battles of the 1800s such as forming firing lines,
            firing in volleys, building fortifications, and overwhelming enemy positions with canon fire (fun fact, this is where
            the phrase "canon fodder" comes from).
        </p>

        <p>
            Player-made "regiments" quickly formed and began organizing battles against each other, which would then lead to the 
            creation of full on military campaigns- a sort of tournament. A regiment is generally formed by its General, followed
            by his or her officers, and lastly the riflemen that make the majority of the troops. Friendly (and sometimes not very 
            friendly) competition between regiments is encouraged and it is what has kept the DLC alive for so long up to this 
            very day.
        </p>

            alt="Image depicting a group of 19th Century soldiers firing artillery at a far off cluster of buildings.">

        <p>
            Every once in a while (usually once every calendar season) two or more regiments organize a campaign wherein they will 
            make a map and divide it in territories that will then be taken and/or lost by whichever regiment wins or loses the 
            battle that takes place in that specific part of the map. The win conditions of every territory can vary, some of them 
            are open field battles where clear communication and skillful placement of troops are key to victory, others might 
            consist of holding siege to a town or castle, and other territories require the teams to capture the other's flag.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rivalries are made, titles are earned, promotions are given. Sometimes the higher ups of the regiments are required to
            give speeches in the presence of the entire company through Discord voice chat, sometimes votes are held to decide who 
            will lead the next battle.

        <p> 
            While Warband’s base game focused heavily on single-player strategy, <em>Napoleonic Wars</em> became one of the most 
            competitive multiplayer environments in the franchise. Formal leagues emerged, complete with weekly fixtures, 
            standings, disciplinary rules, and referees ensuring matches followed agreed-upon protocols. Some regiments 
            handled recruitment the way esports teams do today: applications, trials, and scheduled training hours. Over time, 
            certain regiments gained reputations—some for discipline, some for raw skill, others for their chaotic but oddly 
            effective “charge and pray” strategies. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            Beyond campaigns, the community regularly organizes reenactments, memorial battles, themed events, and historically 
            inspired scenarios. Some regiments stage recreations of famous battles like Austerlitz or Waterloo while 
            others opted for humorous events such as “bayonet-only Fridays,” “musician brawls,” or cavalry jousting tournaments. 
            Over the years, these gatherings have fostered a culture that blended military roleplay with genuine camaraderie, to the 
            point where many players have stayed active in the DLC long after moving on from the Warband base game itself.
